# Optimal bound on qFI based on expectation values of input state

Presentation of the recent advances on the tight bounding of the quantum Fisher
Information.

## Organisation of the code

The code is organized as follows. Firts since it is a small project, all
the source TeX code is in a single file.

Second, the images are in a diferent folder `img/` and the material used for the figures into `img/assets/`. Third about the file organisation, the output PDF should be commited fewer times, just only for big releases.

### Branches and tags

The tags reference to important millestones of the development.

The branches allows for specialised code, for instance, the preparation
of the talk for a different conference or for a different speaker, a new
branch is initialized.

The more active branch will be `master`. So, it is a decision for which
conference the developer will make more changes and split into a new branch
the more static codes.
