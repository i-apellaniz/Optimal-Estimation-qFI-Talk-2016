# Optimal bound on qFI based on expectation values of input state

Presentation of the recent advances on the tight bounding of the quantum Fisher
Information.

## Organisation of the code

The code is organized as follows. Firts since it is a small project, all 
the source TeX code is in a single file. Second the images are in a diferent
folder `img/`. 

The tags reference to important millestones of the development.

The branches allows for specialised code, for instance, the preparation 
of the talk for a different conference or for a different speaker, a new 
branch is initialized.

The more active branch will be `master`. So, it a mate of decision for which
conference the developer will make more changes and split into a new branch
the more static code.
